## Contributors

## Our Goal

The goal of this lab is to learn more about Segues and Navigation Controllers as well as solidify your understanding of the MVC design pattern.

## What you will create

By the end of the lab, you will have made Waitlist Helper. Based on the userâ€™s current waitlist position and total size of the course in which they are trying to enroll, the app will calculate their probability of getting off the waitlist and give them relevant feedback.

## What you will learn

* How to create multi-screen apps with animated navigation.
* How to segregate your app into Model, View, and Controller.
* How to write functions to modularize your code.


## Credits

This lab is based heavily on the "BMI Calculator" tutorial from The App Brewery. Check out the full course at [www.appbrewery.co](https://www.appbrewery.co/)
